# Create a Xamarin Project in Visual Studio

## Overview

In this exercise, you will create a basic Xamarin.Forms project using Visual Studio 2015.

## Objectives

- Create a New Visual Studio Solution
- Ensure the Solution Contains a **Portable Class Library** (PCL)
  - Remove the Getting Started File From The PCL Project
- Ensure the Solution Contains a Xamarin.Forms Project That Targets the **Android** Platform
- (OPTIONAL)
  - Include a Xamarin.Forms Project That Targets the **Universal Windows** Platform (UWP)
- Ensure that your solution can run successfully on a platform of your choice

## Solution

Your solution should look similar to the solution located in this directory: [$/01_createproject/solution/](solution/). The folders in the example may differ slightly from your final folder structure.
