# Xamarin and Azure Mobile App Bootcamp

## Overview

In this bootcamp, we will explore both Xamarin and the Azure App Service Mobile Apps feature using a three-prong approach:

- First, a facilitator will show you how to implement feature
- Next, you will have a hands-on exercise where you try to implement the feature[s] yourself
- Finally, you will either verify with a proctor or verify using the "solution" that you implemented the feature[s]

### Scenario

In this series of exercises, you will be building a basic to-do application using Xamarin for the interfaces and Azure App Service Mobile Apps for the application back-end services.

- Visual Studio 2015 Update 3
