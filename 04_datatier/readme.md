# Implement a Data-Tier Using C# Classes

## Overview

In this exercise, you will move some of the data-related tasks from your **HomePage** class to a seperate data-tier class. You will also make use of an interface so that you can replace the data-tier class later.

## Objectives

  - Define a method to retrieve all todo items
  - Define a method to add a single todo items
- Implement a simple in-memory context class using the interfaces
