# Create an Input Form Using The Entry Class

## Overview

In this exercise, you will add controls to allow users to add new items to your list. You will also need to update the list so that it can dynamically change using a special observable class.

## Objectives

- Add an **Entry** and **Button** control to the **HomePage** class' content.
  - Implement a **Click** event handler for the *Button* to add a new entry to the UI and data-tier.
- Use the **ObservableCollection<>** class to implement a dynamically changing list UI.
